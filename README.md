# Machine-Learning-Flight-Delays-Analysis
I used the R programming language and machine learning techniques to analyze the data from the 2013 NYC Flights dataset. This project gives us an analysis of flight delays from different airlines and airports in New York City, and the top 10 popular destinations. The project approaches the problem of flight delays through visualizations that calculate the number of early flights and delayed flights from each airline. The last part of the project includes the development of a few machine learning modules to attempt to predict whether or not a flight is going to be delayed. The end result is that it is not easy to predict when a flight is going to be delayed, and one of the hints tell us that the month of flight affects the number of flight delays. The fall months and December have more flight delays than other months of the year.
